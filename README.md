# CS 170 Project Spring 2020

Create a folder just outside this current folder called 'outputs'. This will be what stores the outputs generated from the code. Include all the inputs in a folder called 'inputs' in the same location as 'outputs'.

If the 'outputs' folder is empty, comment out lines 37-38 in solver.py before running (this must be done because including that line assumes an output graph for finished_files is already optimal, so every graph in finished_files.txt is skipped over)

Then, from within this current folder, run the command: python3 solver.py
This is our python script that will run all of the algorithms described in our project reflection.
